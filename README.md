This repo contains some code snippets and some some issues which you can work as exercises. It will take you through setting up a database on PlanetScale, getting access to it from command line tools and executing SQL statements against it. The issues also contains pointers to a lot of additional materials.

You start by generating at new repo, using this one as a template.

There's a workflow that starts whne you generate your repository - it copies the template issues over to your own repo - It may take 15-20 seconds to finish - You can monitor it in the __Actions__ tab.
